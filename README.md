## Wedding Details

### A fun use of some basic tools for starting a full-stack web project

This is a simple landing page designed to convey information about an upcoming wedding. It includes a basic form, allowing a user to submit some information about their attendance.

Some choices I made around tooling and structure are over-the-top for a project of this size, but it was a fun opportunity to practice laying groundwork for a project meant to scale much larger.

Namely:

- Rigourously-enforced types
- Loose coupling between the "front-end", API, and data layers

### Tools

- Next.js
- Full-stack TypeScript
- Prisma
- Planetscale
- TanStack Query
- Zod
- React Hook Form
